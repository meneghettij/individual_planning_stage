I don't need all of the variables in the players dataset, so I can filter it to just include the columns of interest; this will be done using the select() function to select the age, played_hours and subscription columns. Since the data shows one variable for each column, I won't use the pivot_wider() or pivot_longer() functions to transform the dataset as it is already in a form where I can start to use the dataset. I will also use the group_by() and summarize() functions to group the columns and perform summary statistics on the dataset. In order to find any trends I will then sort the data in descending order by using the arrange() function. The predictive model I will use will be regression in order to predict the subscription status since the data isn't very linear and the two explanatory variables (age and played_hours) are numeric. Also, since the values in the column \"subscribe\" are categorical, I will use the mutate() and as_factor() functions to convert this into a factor. To make the prediction easier to read, I will use the fct_recode() function to change the TRUE and FALSE values to subscribed and not subscribed so that's what is printed when I go to predict later on."

We can determine from this graph overall, which group is most likely to subscribe to a newsletter based on the number of hours they spend playing the video game. However, the more time spent playing, the shorter the bars and the more difficult it is to read the graph. I would manipulate the dataset more in the future so that the bar graph is easier to read.

    "In order to address my question of interest, I think the best model is a linear regression model. The prediction is a categorical variable (subscribed or not subscribed) and we are trying to determine the probability of subscription based on two explanatory variables. We would also be able to get coefficients that would further help in determining the influence on the predicted outcome. Some of the assumptions I would be making would include assuming there is a linear relationship between the variables, both explanatory variables don't influence each other (independent of each other), and that there aren't outliers in the data that could skew results. Linear regression also has some limitations. Since linear regression is a simpler model, I need to be mindful of underfitting the dataset, preprocessing the data well enough that any extreme outliers don't disproportionately affect my outcomes, and that linearity is important for this model (I may have to change my model to k-nn regression, etc. if the variables don't show a linear relationship).  I will perform a linear regression and k-nn regression (and tune neighbours) and determine the accuracy of both models to select which will perform better based on my needs (whether I would prefer higher precision or recall). I would split the data into 2 sets (training + testing) with a 70% training and 30% testing. I will also use c"
