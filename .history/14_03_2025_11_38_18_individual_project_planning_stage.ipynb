We would get coefficients to determine influence(s) on predicted outcomes. I’m assuming a linear relationship between variables, explanatory variables being independent of each other, and no outliers. I need to be mindful of underfitting, and preprocessing so outliers don't disproportionately affect outcomes. I will perform linear and k-nn regression and select which will perform better based on precision vs. recall needs. I would split the data (70% training, 30% testing), and perform 5 cross-validations. Accuracy can be tested to determine if the model is good for predicting unknown values."
