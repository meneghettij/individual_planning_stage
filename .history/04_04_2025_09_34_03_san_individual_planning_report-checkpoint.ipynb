    "<h4> (1) Background Information </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, Minecraft has remained one of the most popular video games, attracting millions of players worldwide. As a sandbox game that allows users to explore, build, and interact in a virtual world, Minecraft appeals to a wide demographic, from casual beginners to dedicated professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of an ongoing research based on the dataset led by **Frank Wood's Computer Science research group at UBC**, which is studying how people play video games. Their team has set up a dedicated Minecraft server, where players' actions are recorded as they navigate through the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "By applying a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model, we analyze the relationship between a player's engagement metrics (age and played hours) and their likelihood of subscribing. The dataset is preprocessed to convert categorical variables into factors, scale numerical values, and split into training and testing subsets. The model is then fine-tuned using cross-validation to determine the optimal number of neighbors (K) before making predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study provides insights into the characteristics of subscribed players and explores whether playtime and age can serve as reliable indicators of subscription likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> (2) Questions </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "**My broad question** - Question 1: Player characteristics and behaviors most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter. <br>\n",
    "**Specific** - \"Can player experience level, total playtime, and age predict whether a player will subscribe to a game-related newsletter?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> (3) Data Description </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our given data is recording players' actions within Minecraft (Woods). Our project will analyze the dataset players and their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *players*, there are 196 observations with 7 variables:\n",
    "- `experience` (character): the level of expertise the player has within Minecraft separated (best to worst): Beginner, Regular, Amateur, Pro, and Veteran\n",
    "- `subscribed`(boolean): whether the player is subscribed to newsletter (TRUE) or not (FALSE)\n",
    "- `hashedEmail`(character): player's encrypted and anonymized email (used for identification)\n",
    "- `played_hours`(double): the amount of hours played by player\n",
    "- `name`(character): name of the player\n",
    "- `gender` (character): player's gender\n",
    "- `Age`(double): player's age <br>"

    "### (4) Methods and Plans\n",

    "- `experience` (Categorical)\n",
    "- `age` (Quantitative)\n",
    "- `played_hours` (Quantitative)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions Required\n",
    "- Since k-NN relies on distance, we assume our dataset is unstandardized and have to normalize numerical quantities.\n",
    "- Dataset should not skew toward a majority range, but early data suggests overrepresentation in specific `age` and `played_hours` ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses\n",
    "- The `age` variable is slightly imbalanced, with a dominant 0-25 range, which may bias predictions based on the range's trends.\n",
    "- `played_hours` has the same problem with a range 0-10 hours played.\n",
    "- Too many predictor variables can make k-NN less effective if some chosen predictors are less reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processing, Comparing, Selecting\n",
    "- Preprocessing includes standardization and handling missing values (NA).\n",
    "- To ensure reliable model fitting,:\n",
    "  1. Split the data into training and testing, with an 80-20% split, stratifying by `subscribe`.\n",
    "  2. Use 10-fold cross-validation to determine the best number of neighbours and train the model on both sets.\n",
    "  3. Evaluate our model on the testing data and collect metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prioritizing **high precision** is the key, as the newsletter would benefit more from identifying which characteristics subscribe more correctly (for more effective marketing campaigns) rather than maximizing subscriber identification (recall) or general proportion of correctness (accuracy).\n"
