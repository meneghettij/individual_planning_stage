    "I think the best model would be linear regression. The prediction is a categorical variable and we are trying to determine the probability of subscription based on two explanatory variables. We would also be able to get coefficients that would further help in determining the influence on the predicted outcome. Some of the assumptions I would be making would include assuming there is a linear relationship between the variables, both explanatory variables don't influence each other (independent of each other), and that there aren't outliers in the data that could skew results. Linear regression also has some limitations. Since linear regression is a simpler model, I need to be mindful of underfitting the dataset, preprocessing the data well enough that any extreme outliers don't disproportionately affect my outcomes, and that linearity is important for this model (I may have to change my model to k-nn regression, etc. if the variables don't show a linear relationship).  I will perform a linear regression and k-nn regression (and tune neighbours) and determine the accuracy of both models to select which will perform better based on my needs (whether I would prefer higher precision or recall). I would split the data into 2 sets (training + testing) with a 70% training and 30% testing. I will also use cross-validation to perform at least 5 cross-validations (k = 5) to reduce chances of over/underfitting. Once I have created the model based on my training set, I will then test on my testing set to see the accuracy and determine if the model is good for predicting unknown values."
